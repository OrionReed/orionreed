### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My research investigates the intersection of computing, human-system interfaces, and emancipatory politics. I am interested in the potential of computing as a medium for thought, as a tool for collective action, and as a means of emancipation.

My current focus is basic research into the nature of digital organisation, developing theoretical toolkits to improve shared infrastructure, and applying this research to the design of new systems and protocols which support the self-organisation of knowledge and computational artifacts.
