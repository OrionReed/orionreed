### Hello! 👋
I am an applied researcher investigating the intersection of _computing, human-system interfaces, and the political economy of software._ I am interested in the potential of computing as a medium for thought, as a tool for collective action, and as a means of emancipation. My current focus is on malleable software and understanding our _mode of software production._
